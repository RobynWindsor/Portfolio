    <h3>Before Front-End <i class="art fa-solid fa-palette"></i></h3>

    <section class="aboutMeText">
      <p>
        For over a decade, I immersed myself in the picture framing industry,
        evolving from a junior consultant to a studio manager, lead consultant,
        and project manager. My journey has taken me through various roles in
        workshops, honing the crafts and skills needed for high-end bespoke
        picture framing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've collaborated with prestigious galleries, artists, art fairs,
        collectors, and interior designers. My role demanded a strong grasp of
        design, aesthetics, functionality, budgeting, market trends, and above
        all, problem-solving. Ensuring every frame's perfection has been my
        mission, requiring impeccable collaboration and communication skills to
        unite cross-functional teams on diverse projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        The collaboration and communication skills I have developed has proven
        to be the key to my success when bringing cross-functional teams and
        individuals together on small and large projects.

    <h3>2023 Summer Romance <i class="fire fa-solid fa-fire"></i></h3>
    <section class="aboutMeText">
      <p>Fast forward to 2023 where my love for front-end web development</p>

      <p>
        My desire to continuously learn, create and problem solve was instantly
        ignited with my first few lines of code, as I built my first basic
        landing page in HTML and CSS.It felt like magic and as if I had
        discovered a whole new world full of endless possibilities. Which is
        exactly what it was!
      </p>
      <p>
        Front-end development allows me to blend creativity with technology. I
        get to transform static design concepts into interactive and visually
        appealing websites and applications. The ability to create beautiful and
        user-friendly interfaces is incredibly rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into front-end development coincided with a deepening
        interest in climate tech and reducing carbon emissions. I believe
        technology can be a powerful force for positive change in addressing
        climate change. Integrating sustainable practices into web development,
        such as optimizing performance to reduce energy consumption, aligns with
        my commitment to environmental responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm eager to leverage my skills in front-end development to contribute
        to projects that promote sustainability and combat climate change. By
        harnessing technology for good, we can create a greener, more
        sustainable future for generations to come.
