    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h3 class="aboutMe">
      My journey into the colorful world of web development started with a
      fascination for how a bunch of lines of code could turn into beautiful,
      interactive playgrounds. I realized that with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as
      my trusty companions, I could craft digital experiences that make people
      go <span class="highlight">Wow</span>! Design isn't just what it looks
      like; it's how it works. I'm a firm believer in this principle. My
      approach to front-end development is
      <span class="highlight">design-driven</span>, with a focus on creating
      intuitive, user-centered interfaces that seamlessly merge form and
      function. Hello, and welcome to my profile. I am a London based Front-End
      Developer with a strong background as a Studio Manager for a high-end
      picture framing company. My journey into the colourful world of web
      development is infused with lessons from my background in picture framing.
      Let me tell you about my journey. Studio Manager I am a dedicated and
      accomplished Studio Manager with 10 years’ experience in the high- end
      picture framing industry. Working with art fairs, galleries, and renowned

      ensuring that each piece of art is treated with utmost care and precision.
      This unique experience has provided me with invaluable lessons in project
      management, client communication, a keen eye for aesthetics and attention
      to detail. Values that I carry into my coding. Front-End Developer My
      journey as a Front-End Developer started out of a passion to bridge the
      gap between design and technology. I am passionate about crafting digital
      experiences that are not only visually stunning but also seamlessly
      functional. With a keen eye for aesthetics and an in-depth understanding
      of user experiences my goal is to create applications that not only look
      amazing but also provide an intuitive and enjoyable user experience. Check
      out the projects page to see my work. The Synergy My unique blend of
      skills as a Front-End developer and Studio Manager allows me to bring a
      holistic approach to every project. Attention to detail, precision and an
      acute sense of aesthetics are values I carry into coding. If you’re
