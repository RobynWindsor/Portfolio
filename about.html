    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
      <h3>Before Front-End</h3>
      <p>
        I've been in the picture framing industry for a decade, where I started
        off as a junior consultant. I soon found myself exploring the picture
        framing industry intensively. Over the years I've had roles in workshops
        where I learnt the many different crafts and skills needed to make high
        end bespoke picture frames.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am now a studio manager, lead consultant and project manager. My
        extensive experience has allowed me to work closely with some of the
        world's most prestigious galleries, artists (actors and musicians too),
        art fairs, collectors, and interior designers. This requires a strong
        understanding of design, aesthetic, functionality, budgeting and market
        trends.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have developed excellent collaboration and communication skills which
        has proven to be the key to my success when bringing cross-functional
        teams and individuals together on small and large projects. Bringing new
        ideas to life ignites my imagination, whether it be with the product
        itself or processes and procedures within my company such as KPI's,
        sales and finding new avenues to increase production efficiency.

      <h3>2023 Summer Romance</h3>
      <p>
        Fast forward to 2023 where my romance with front-end development
        started! I found a company called SheCodes who offered courses in web
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        My desire to continuously learn and create was instantly ignited with my
        first few lines of code, as I built my first basic landing page in HTML
        and CSS. It felt like magic and like I had discovered a whole new world
        full of endless possibilities. Which is exactly what it is.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have since hooked these skills onto my front-end tool belt: API's,
        libraries (bootstrap, tail wind), React (jsx), NodeJs, Html5, CSS3,
        JavaScript, Python, Responsive design,
