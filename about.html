    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
      <h3>Before Front-End <i class="fa-solid fa-palette"></i></h3>
      <p>
        I've been in the picture framing industry for a decade, where I started
        off as a junior consultant. I soon found myself exploring the picture
        framing industry intensively. Over the years I've had roles in workshops
        where I learnt the many different crafts and skills needed to make high
        end bespoke picture frames.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am now a studio manager, lead consultant and project manager. My
        extensive experience has allowed me to work closely with some of the
        world's most prestigious galleries, artists (actors and musicians too),
        art fairs, collectors, and interior designers. This requires a strong
        understanding of design, aesthetic, functionality, budgeting, market
        trends and most of all, a lot of problem - solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        The collaboration and communication skills I have developed has proven
        to be the key to my success when bringing cross-functional teams and
        individuals together on small and large projects.

      <h3>2023 Summer Romance <i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i></h3>
      <p>
        Fast forward to 2023 where my love for front-end web development began.
        I found a company called SheCodes who offered courses in web
        development, and I signed up for their Max porgramme which is their
        biggest programme they offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My desire to continuously learn and create was instantly ignited with my
        first few lines of code, as I built my first basic landing page in HTML
        and CSS. It felt like magic and like I had discovered a whole new world
        full of endless possibilities. Which is exactly what it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have since hooked these skills and many more onto my front-end tool
        belt: API's, libraries (bootstrap, tail wind), React (jsx), NodeJs,
        Html5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Responsive design,
      </p>
